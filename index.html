<h1><center><i>My Motivation Factor Towards Online Education</i></center></h1>

<h3><b>My Life Goal is to:</b> <q>Get Better Grade in Degree</q></h3>

<p>Here is a Quote From New Strait Time Website</p>
<em><blockquote cite="https://www.nst.com.my/education/2020/04/586565/uitm-moves-online-learning-mode">
Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) has moved all classes to open and distance learning (ODL) mode effective April 13 until the end of the semester for all its campuses nationwide.</blockquote></em>

<p>The <abbr title="Universiti Teknologi Mara">UiTM</abbr> has make a decision to make Online Distance Learning (ODL), so we as student must follow all their planning to make sure this semester going smoothly.  Today, I want to share some<ins> factor that student can use to motivate their self to accept online education.</ins></p>

<ol>
	<li><B>USEFULNESS</B></li>
<P>First, student must understand why they create ODL. The reason why ODL has been approved is to help student be more independent to improve our study method. For student Office Software this oportunity is realy usefull because we can improve our self in technology and feel like in working environment. Moreover, we must set in our mind that any skills that we will acquire in a course will directly contribute to our success in a chosen profession field.  OLD also help us to Improve our skill such as research skill because we need to do research to understand sentence topic. </P>
	<li><B>INTEREST</B></li>
<p>There are two types of interest that contribute to student motivation which are situational interest and individual interest. Situational interest refers to an aspect of a course that is enjoyable or fun. For example, we enjoy learning using video conference which is new situation for us.  Individual interest, which refers to how the content relates to the individual. For example, we are taking Office Software cost because have a strong individual interest in the content based on how the content related to who we are and what we aspire to.  This also Can be applied in who rate for ODL, which mean who interest in online education. For who cannot accept ODL, there must change their perception and try to get interest either in situational or individual.</p>
	<li><B>CARING</B></li>
<p>Instructor must care to their student.  We need to feel that the instructor care about what we need to learn.  This is important because caring is a big motivator for people. For who said that caring would not important in online higher education courses, he is wrong because caring can give positive vibe to person.  For example, my lecturer always reminds her student to submit their assignment and always open to student who want to ask question.  This was increasing my spirit to work hard because my lecturer is trying hard to make sure all of his student success even though in ODL.</p>
	<li><B>SUCCESS</B></li>
<p>Students need to feel that they can succeed in the course even though in ODL if they make a reasonable effort. The instructor can help students succeed by setting expectations, providing guideline and providing feedback.   ODL make student more independent because the timetable is a lot more flexible now and no more term depending on friends because all of our friend is far away. After all, no more group assignment and this will increase our own responsibilities on assignment.  This will create a strong soul of student and will give a positive impact in future such as be a successful person.</p>
